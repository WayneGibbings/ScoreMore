# ScoreMore - Enhancement Roadmap

This document outlines planned enhancements and feature additions for the ScoreMore application, organized by priority and complexity.

## High Priority

### Requested features
- [x] Add Edit feature for completed games - allow editing the team names
- [x] Change Completed Game summary to not show "0 goals" if a player didn't score but just their name. Also sort the player list.
- [x] Add a "copy to clipboard" button on the finished game results. This should copy the team names and scores, and the list of players and goals scored to the clipboard. This will be used to update the team chat and email and elsewhere
- [x] Add feedback button that emails wayne+scoremore@gibbings.net
- [x] Add a footer to the app with some details like build date/time.
- [x] Add ability to add, edit, and delete notes during games

## Implementation Notes

### Remote Storage Approach
The transition from localStorage to remote storage should be incremental:
1. First, implement read-only synchronization from local to remote
2. Then add bi-directional sync with conflict resolution
3. Finally, make remote storage primary with local caching

### Authentication Implementation
Authentication should be implemented using industry standards:
- JWT for API authentication
- Secure HTTP-only cookies for web sessions
- Refresh token rotation for extended sessions
- Rate limiting for login attempts

### Team Profile Design
Team profiles should include:
- Persistent roster management
- Player details (positions, numbers, stats)
- Attendance tracking history
- Performance metrics over time
- Team settings and configurations

### Database Schema Evolution
The current schema will need extensions:
- User accounts table
- Extended team and player metadata
- Game configuration options
- Permissions and access control
- Audit logs for scoring changes
